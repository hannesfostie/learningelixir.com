  <h1>I, <a href="https://twitter.com/philnash">Phil Nash</a>, am learning Elixir now!</h1>

  <p>This is a statement of my intent to follow through learning a new language, along with its frameworks, tools and ecosystem.</p>

  <p>This site will also be a resource for places I am using to learn Elixir as well as a place to write my own experiences.</p>

  <p>It is also <a href="https://github.com/philnash/learningelixir.com/tree/gh-pages">open source and available on GitHub</a>, so please feel free to suggest resources or articles for inclusion.</p>
